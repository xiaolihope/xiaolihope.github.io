In software engineering, a [design pattern] is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software
design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or
template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

## Creational Patterns
These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns
and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process,
object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.
### Abstrace Factory
### Builder
### Factory Method
### Object Pool
### Prototype
### Singleton

## Structural Patterns
These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to
compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

### Adapter
### Bridge
### Composite
### Decorator
### Facade
### Flyweight
### Private Class Data
### Proxy

## Behavioral Patterns
In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns
between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

### Chain of responsibility
### Command
### Interpreter
### Interator
### Mediator
### Memento
### Null Object
### Observer
### State
### Strategy
### Template method
### Visitor
